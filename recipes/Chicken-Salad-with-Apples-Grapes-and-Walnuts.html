    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This chicken salad with apples gets extra crunch from walnuts and a subtle sweetness
         from grapes. I had chicken breasts left over from a BBQ but I couldn't find a recipe
          I liked, so I played around and came up with this.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cooked chicken breasts, shredded</li>
        <li>2 medium Granny Smith apples, cut into small chunks</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped walnuts, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup vanilla yogurt</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®)</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>25 seedless red grapes, halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
